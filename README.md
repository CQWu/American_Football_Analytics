## Brief History of American Football

A concise overview of how American football evolved from early collegiate ‚Äúmob‚Äù games, through Walter Camp‚Äôs rule standardization, to the establishment of the NFL and today‚Äôs modern era.

## American Football Rule Basics

Key rules and terminology every analyst should know:

- **Downs & Yardage**  
- **Scoring: Touchdowns, Field Goals, Extra Points**  
- **Timing & Clock Management**  
- **Penalties & Formations**  

## Introduction to Football Analytics

Why analytics matters in football:

- History of data in sport  
- The Moneyball analogy and analytics adoption in the NFL  
- Common data sources and performance metrics  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Techniques and examples for summarizing and visualizing football data:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Descriptive statistics (yards, points, efficiency)  
- Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps  

## Simple Linear Regression

Modeling relationships with one predictor:

- Theory & assumptions  
- Fitting a model: yards per carry vs. rushing attempts  
- Interpretation of coefficients & goodness-of-fit  

## Multiple Regression

Extending to multiple predictors:

- Model specification & multicollinearity  
- Example: predicting team success from offensive and defensive metrics  
- Model diagnostics & validation  

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

Handling non‚Äênormal outcomes:

- Logistic regression for win/loss classification  
- Poisson regression for count data (e.g., touchdowns per game)  
- Model selection and interpretation  

## Web Scraping for Football Data

Automating data collection:

- Identifying target websites (e.g., Pro Football Reference)  
- Using Python tools: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`  
- Best practices and ethical considerations  

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Dimensionality reduction for high‚Äêdimensional datasets:

- PCA theory & variance explained  
- Application: reducing play‚Äêby‚Äêplay features  
- Visualization of principal components  

## Advanced Tools and Libraries

Overview of specialized packages and frameworks:

- **`statsmodels`** & **`scikit-learn`** for modeling  
- **`PySpark`** for large‚Äêscale data processing  
- **`TensorFlow`**, **`PyTorch`** for deep learning approaches  

## Advanced Topics & Case Studies

Deep‚Äêdive into complex analyses and real‚Äêworld examples:

- **Expected Points Added (EPA)** and **Win Probability Models**  
- **Player tracking data** and spatio‚Äêtemporal modeling  
- **Causal inference** in evaluating rule changes
